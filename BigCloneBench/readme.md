For BigCloneBench (<https://github.com/jeffsvajlenko/BigCloneEval>) dataset, because it does not provide the
dependency libraries for most of the source code files, we select
these successfully compiled files as our final dataset. The total
number of final clone pairs is 280,390 including 8,139 Type-1 clones,
3,292 Type-2 clones, 4,496 Strongly Type-3 clones, 7,606 Moderately
Type-3 clones, and 256,857 Weakly Type-3/Type-4 clones.

The dataset we uploaded consists of 280,390 clone pairs, each of which corresponding to a pair of control flow graphs.
